        <h2>What is Sustainable development?</h2>
        <p>
            <b>"Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."</b><br><br>
            The concept of sustainable development can be interpreted in many different ways, but at its core is an approach to development that looks to balance different, and often competing, needs against an awareness of the environmental, social and economic limitations we face as a society.

            All too often, development is driven by one particular need, without fully considering the wider or future impacts. We are already seeing the damage this kind of approach can cause, from large-scale financial crises caused by irresponsible banking, to changes in global climate resulting from our dependence on fossil fuel-based energy sources. The longer we pursue unsustainable development, the more frequent and severe its consequences are likely to become, which is why we need to take action now.  
        </p>

        <h2>Why is Environmental protection and Sustainable development needed?</h2>
        <p>
            From the last two or three decades, we have seen that for the sake of economic growth, the health of the environment has taken a toll. As a result, there has been an impact on the environment such as decline in air quality and climate change due to greenhouse gases.
            All these factors led to the need for sustainable development, as if left unchecked it can cause irreversible damage to the environment.
        </p>
        <h4>Objective of sustainable development</h4>
        <p>
            1. <b>Economic Growth:</b> For creating an economy that is sustainable and growing in the right direction.<br>
            2. <b>Protecting the Environment:</b> This objective focuses on contribution by humans towards protecting and enhancing the natural environment, by minimising pollution and waste, also working towards reducing the global carbon footprint.<br>
            3. <b>Social Inclusion:</b> This objective focuses on providing the facility of housing for future generations and assisting in creating healthy, strong and vibrant global communities.
        </p>
        <h4>Importance of sustainable development</h4>
        <p>
            Following are the importance of sustainable development:<br>
            1. Using the available resources judiciously and working towards maintaining the ecological balance.<br>
            2.To prevent degradation of the environment and laying emphasis on protecting the environment.<br>
            3. To prevent overexploitation of resources.<br>

            <p>
                <b>Benefits Of Eco-Friendly products:</b><br><br>
                Using eco-friendly products is the need of the hour. When there is widespread destruction of natural resources taking place worldwide, the earth is being exploited and overtaxed; it is the use of eco-friendly products that can take some burden off the shoulders of nature.<br>
                <b>1. You Help Save Nature</b><br>
                Over-exploitation, pollution, and destruction of natural resources can cause an imbalance in nature. Since mankind is a part of nature, it is crucial to switch to eco-friendly products to help save nature from destruction.<br>
                <b>2. Save Mankind</b><br>
                Everything in this world is interdependent. If any part of nature is affected, humans too will be affected by it- directly or indirectly. We see how many new diseases are creeping into society every day- all this has roots lying in the irresponsible production and disposal of products.<br>
                <b>3. Better Climate</b><br>
                Climate change is real, and it is happening at an extremely faster rate than it was a few decades ago. The extremes of temperatures of both heat and cold have a devastating effect on all aspects of our life- right from health to agriculture, ice caps, and even our flora and fauna. Using eco-friendly products can help combat this effect and ensure better climatic conditions for the future.<br>
                <b>4. A Healthier Life</b><br>
                All-natural products are devoid of chemicals that adversely affect human health. If you switch to eco-friendly products, you are helping nature from a broader perspective and choosing to live a healthier, safer, non-toxic, chemical-free life for yourself.<br>
                <b>5. Cost-Effective</b><br>
                Eco-friendly products often run on non-exhaustive resources of the environment. This means that they are more cost-effective than any other artificially made product available.<br>
